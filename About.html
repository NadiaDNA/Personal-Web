            <h1>Let's read <span>My stories!</span></h1>
            <p>I have a background in <span>Chemical Engineering </span> and started my career in the FMCG industry as a</p>
            <p><span> Group Leader in chocolate production.</span> Stepping into a <span>leadership role</span> right after graduate was</p>
            <p>both challenging and rewarding. That experience shaped me a lot. It taught me how to lead not</p>
            <p>only a team, but also myself. I learned to stay adaptable, solve problems under pressure, and</p>
            <p>grow together with the people I worked with.</p><br />
            <p>Currently, I work as a <span>freelance science teacher.</span> Teaching feels more like a calling to me. I truly</p>
            <p>enjoy witnessing growth, whether it's in myself or in my students. Guiding others and sharing</p>
            <p>knowledge inspires me to keep learning too.</p><br />
            <p>Now, I'm also exploring a new journey in <span>web development.</span> I see it as another exciting field that I</p>
            <p>can keep learning, experimenting, and building meaningful things. beside of work, I love exploring</p>
            <p>creativity through food, science, and technology especially sharing the journey along the way.</p>
